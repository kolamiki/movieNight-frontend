# üé¨ Movie Night ‚Äì Frontend

**Movie Night** (Polish: _Wieczorek Filmowy_) is a web application designed to help groups of friends organize thematic movie nights with collaborative movie voting. This repository contains the frontend part of the application.

## üöÄ Overview

Movie Night makes it easy to organize fun and engaging movie events. Here's how it works:

1. **Create an Event** ‚Äì The organizer sets up a new movie night by providing:

   - A **Title** (e.g. "Retro Sci-Fi", "Oscar Winners", etc.)
   - A **short description**
   - The **location** of the screening
   - A curated list of movie candidates pulled from the **IMDB** integration

2. **Invite Friends** ‚Äì Participants can join the event and view the list of candidate films.

3. **Vote!** ‚Äì Each attendee casts **one vote** for their favorite movie.

4. **Enjoy the Show** ‚Äì The winning film becomes the evening‚Äôs feature presentation!

Whether you're hosting a cozy evening at home or a big-screen garden party, Movie Night helps streamline the decision-making process in a fun and social way.
